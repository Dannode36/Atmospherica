# BetterFog
Distance based fog shader for Minecraft

*Pretty basic fog options right now but v2.0 will come with better performance (especially on the noise side of things), improved customisation of the fog itself, full replacement of Minecraft's built-in fog and better/more accurate ray marching. v3.0 might even have interaction with light sources :0*
